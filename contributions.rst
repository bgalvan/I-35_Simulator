Bobby:
I developed the Linked List objects and methods for passing Vehicle array index numbers into their respective nodes in the linked list.
Initialized a 2D array of linked lists objects into the highway setup to represent each lane.
I developed the control mechanisms for driver behaviors (speeding up, slowing down) in relation to other cars (CarAheadIndex),
Finally I worked out and implemented the Passing logic within our Linked List/Array hybrid setup.
